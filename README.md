# EyezOn SmartThings Switch
This assumes you have:
* [SmartThings Hub](https://www.smartthings.com/products/smartthings-hub)
* Home security system coupled to an [EyezOn EnvisaLink](http://www.eyezon.com/index.php) module

This program will enable you to create a virtual switch in your SmartThings that will integrate with your EnvisaLink module. This will allow you to arm/disarm your home security system in the desired mode (stay/away) through SmartThings, just like with any other switch. Then you can do cool stuff like:
* [Away] Arm system when everyone leaves the house
* Disarm system when someone arrives
* [Stay] Arm system by saying "Alexa, Goodnight!" (via SmartThings-Alexa integration)
* Disarm system by saying "Alexa, Good Morning!" (via SmartThings-Alexa integration)

**Note: This program makes use of internet connection to EyezOn server and therefore requires your hub to be able to communicate with the outside world i.e. it is NOT executed locallty and will not work when your home internet connection is down.**
